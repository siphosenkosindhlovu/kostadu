Relying on technology to make business processes simpler, reach broader audiences, or focus on particular customers, they often compete against more traditional economic actors who used less efficient business methods.

However, British startups are also well-represented, thanks to the British economy\u2019s traditional focus on the financial industry and the City of London being one of the world\u2019s top financial centers.</p>\n<p>China counts several other companies involved in payments and other financial services, which are already publicly listed companies.

And it\u2019s going to switch banking as we know\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>For short, financial technology, or FinTech, is the innovative use of technology to design and deliver business assistance. It\u2019s changing finance through a broad range of benefits and technologies, from artificial intelligence and blockchain to digital payments and robot-advisors.</p>\n<p>Fintechs typically offer \u201cbetter user experience, lower fees, and a customized focus on clearing up a fixed issue. They can also develop products faster and cheaper than big banks as they don\u2019t have the legacy staff and systems to fund or contend\u00a0with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Traditional banks are generally slower to the punch when it comes to this, and charges will hit many people, large margins, and limited hours in which they can seek assistance from customer\u00a0support.</p>\n<p>The big banks\u2019 infrastructure also allows little room for agility\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning that fintech could extent and grow aggressively, offering new products and services all the time, while the banks are merely getting on digital technologies to improve their existing services.</p>\n<p><strong>A bit of\u00a0history</strong></p>\n<p>Historically, as technology evolved, the banking services industry used to be quite fast to adopt innovations to serve customers better. However, all of this changed during the global financial crisis of\u00a02008.</p>\n<p>During the crisis, banks focused on complying with the numerous new rules, regulatory requirements, and fines imposed on them. Innovation was a very distant priority.</p>\n<p>In the same period, technology was having an unprecedented boom. During that same period, there was a series of game-changing technological innovations that transformed how we lived and became part of our daily lives\u200a\u2014\u200athe iPhone, Airbnb, Uber, WhatsApp, WeChat\u200a\u2014\u200afor example. There was already a considerable gap between traditional banks\u2019 technologies and the rising standards of modern customers. They demanded more flexibility, convenience, and a streamlined user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>How are banks reacting?</strong></p>\n<p>Banks are worried about these large tech firms as they not only have much-existing information with clients like yourselves every day but also have, to a precise extent, your protection and assurance. For example, if you share your kids\u2019 photos on Facebook, wouldn\u2019t you count on them to transfer money to your family as well? If you buy most of your daily basics from Amazon, wouldn\u2019t you also use them to search and purchase insurance products as\u00a0well?</p>\n<p>What also worries banks is that thousands of new and dynamic FinTech startups now offer products that used to be controlled by traditional financial players. For example, peer to peer lending platforms now provides customers an alternative for loans that you used to get from a bank. Robo-advisory platforms offer asset management solutions that are more transparent in what they charge you and substantially cheaper.</p>\n<p>But banks realize that the landscape is changing and surviving. They need to develop. Some banks will thrive in this evolution by embedding this culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across their organization. But many will\u00a0not.</p>\n<p>Citibank predicts that over the next ten years, direct job losses but also indirect ones will damage the related economy around the financial services industry, from law firms and accounting firms to hotels and restaurants. In the future, some new jobs will create with FinTechs but in substantially smaller numbers. And these are very different jobs with very different skill sets than those required from bankers today\u200a\u2014\u200athese new jobs are for programmers and data scientists, not traders or compliance officers.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the FinTech industry is continuing to transform how financial services are delivered. Consumers will generally be great beneficiaries from a user experience or convenience perspective and access and cost\u00a0savings.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=96d45befb3c4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

They can also develop products faster and cheaper than big banks as they don\u2019t have the legacy staff and systems to fund or contend\u00a0with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Traditional banks are generally slower to the punch when it comes to this, and charges will hit many people, large margins, and limited hours in which they can seek assistance from customer\u00a0support.</p>\n<p>The big banks\u2019 infrastructure also allows little room for agility\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning that fintech could extent and grow aggressively, offering new products and services all the time, while the banks are merely getting on digital technologies to improve their existing services.</p>\n<p><strong>A bit of\u00a0history</strong></p>\n<p>Historically, as technology evolved, the banking services industry used to be quite fast to adopt innovations to serve customers better. However, all of this changed during the global financial crisis of\u00a02008.</p>\n<p>During the crisis, banks focused on complying with the numerous new rules, regulatory requirements, and fines imposed on them. Innovation was a very distant priority.</p>\n<p>In the same period, technology was having an unprecedented boom. During that same period, there was a series of game-changing technological innovations that transformed how we lived and became part of our daily lives\u200a\u2014\u200athe iPhone, Airbnb, Uber, WhatsApp, WeChat\u200a\u2014\u200afor example. There was already a considerable gap between traditional banks\u2019 technologies and the rising standards of modern customers. They demanded more flexibility, convenience, and a streamlined user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>How are banks reacting?</strong></p>\n<p>Banks are worried about these large tech firms as they not only have much-existing information with clients like yourselves every day but also have, to a precise extent, your protection and assurance. For example, if you share your kids\u2019 photos on Facebook, wouldn\u2019t you count on them to transfer money to your family as well? If you buy most of your daily basics from Amazon, wouldn\u2019t you also use them to search and purchase insurance products as\u00a0well?</p>\n<p>What also worries banks is that thousands of new and dynamic FinTech startups now offer products that used to be controlled by traditional financial players. For example, peer to peer lending platforms now provides customers an alternative for loans that you used to get from a bank. Robo-advisory platforms offer asset management solutions that are more transparent in what they charge you and substantially cheaper.</p>\n<p>But banks realize that the landscape is changing and surviving. They need to develop. Some banks will thrive in this evolution by embedding this culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across their organization. But many will\u00a0not.</p>\n<p>Citibank predicts that over the next ten years, direct job losses but also indirect ones will damage the related economy around the financial services industry, from law firms and accounting firms to hotels and restaurants. In the future, some new jobs will create with FinTechs but in substantially smaller numbers. And these are very different jobs with very different skill sets than those required from bankers today\u200a\u2014\u200athese new jobs are for programmers and data scientists, not traders or compliance officers.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the FinTech industry is continuing to transform how financial services are delivered. Consumers will generally be great beneficiaries from a user experience or convenience perspective and access and cost\u00a0savings.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=96d45befb3c4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n",

It is about people adopting the technology\u201d, said Ruben in an intriguing session on contactless payment with Kosta Du. Every country is different, and every country reacts to technology differently. Fintech in the UK can be completely different from fintech in the USA. To explore the diverse ecosystem of Latin America, Kosta du interviewed Ruben Raul Diaz Silva. From locals adjusting with the technology to the cybersecurity condition, they discussed various elements of fintech beyond today. They discussed the future of contactless payments in\u00a0America.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Ruben Raul Diaz Silva has been working in Information and communication technology for 25 years. In 2010 he was appointed as the vice minister of telecommunications in Ecuador. His focus is on developing fintech in Ecuador Banking software companies. He explains to the credit unions and various companies about the world of fintech. He assists the Information technology companies who plan to settle in America. From the condition of the fintech industry to the cultural background of the country, he supervises various institutions in all aspects. Thus, he is the ideal person to learn from the status of contactless payments and fintech in Latin\u00a0America.</p>\n<p><strong>Condition Of Contactless Payment In Latin\u00a0America</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, in America, contactless payment is a rare phenomenon. In Latin America, people are still using magnetic cards to make payments. America is planning to introduce 100 million neo contactless cards next year. According to Ruben, the reason behind the scarcity of contactless payment in America is the lack of stimulus. America has the technology to shift to contactless payments, but the people were not ready to adopt such technology. They needed an external stimulus to motivate them to use contactless payments, and COVID-19 has proved to be a great stimulus. Thus, in the coming 1 or 2 financial years, the financial industry will witness significant developments in terms of technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyber Security In Latin\u00a0America</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike Zimbabwe, South Africa, or the Republic of the Congo, America is not scared to use contactless payments due to security reasons. Cybersecurity is highly developed in Latin America. The financial institutions are always on alert mode and have developed their security system to be immune to any kind of\u00a0fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Problems With Contactless Payment In Latin\u00a0America</strong></p>\n<p>As explained by Ruben, the real problems with contactless payment in America are the proportion of bank users and lack of experience in American technology developers. In Latin America, approximately 70% of citizens do not have a formal bank account. So without having a bank account, it is impossible to carry out the contactless payment. Another reason is that small businesses in America cannot afford the expensive system required for enabling card payments. But the silver lining is the contactless payment requires only a $100 smartphone and a visa Mastercard. If American banks are interested, they can also launch the POS system for contactless payments. Furthermore, technology developers are not experienced in dealing with the regulators or reaching the global\u00a0market.</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities For Fintech In Latin\u00a0America</strong></p>\n<p>The UK has the one thing that America lacks. A mutual understanding between the Us based start-ups and UK fintech could lead to a huge opportunity for both the participants. United states are like an underserved nation. It has the resources, but the proportion of populations served by the banks are very\u00a0low.</p>\n<p>In the case of Neo banks, also the regulators in Brazil won\u2019t allow the launching of a 100% digital bank. Some kind of physical presence will be necessary because practically without cash, one could not create credit. Since COVID-19 has played the role of a stimulus, America will soon be comfortable with contactless payments. But for entering a new market, it is important for information technology companies to make adjustments. Ruben closes with the suggestion that if you are entering a new country, a political and cultural survey is indispensable. America may not be open to contactless payment today, but with the current pace of development in a few years, the traditional means of payment might disappear, leaving behind only contactless payments.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d40e81535154\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du/contactless-payment-in-latin-america-with-ruben-raul-diaz-silva-d40e81535154\">Contactless Payment In Latin America With Ruben Raul Diaz Silva</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du\">Kosta Du</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

Tech in the past few years has completely revolutionized the concept of delivery of financial service and it has positively aided the development of this sector.

But since banks by their nature are huge, and they are unable to innovate fast, they need assistance. This is where FinTech comes in. It tries to reduce the existing gap between small skills and big banks so that it can bring up innovative solutions to serve the customers and to generate revenues from\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>The digital banks that are functioning today are putting in efforts to differentiate themselves from the traditional banks. So, if you approach any digital bank for setting up a business account, unlike the traditional banks that take about 2\u20134 weeks to complete the process, the digital banks are getting everything done in about 15\u201320 minutes. These banks are also offering highly intuitive and easy to use apps, that is granting an exceptional customer experience. And finally, the digital banks also giving customers access to a local switch or separate faster payments. These are some reasons why digital banks are being seen in a different light.</p>\n<p>Now, as for the fundamentals of growth of these banks in the future, they can be identified very easily. All that a bank needs to do in order to survive the future is to figure out who is your target audience, what is your proposition, and what services can you provide your customers that are easily accessible and can be offered at cheaper rates. Once you have your different proposition, your different way of positioning things for a particular target audience base in place your growth will\u00a0begin.</p>\n<p>In order to grow and succeed in the future, another angle that banks can consider is problem-solving. So if you are a bank who is solving a problem for its customer, then the chances of your survival in the future double-up. <em>Channel vast</em> is one company that is doing this.

I received one device from the first batch that has manufactured for sales. Unboxing a new device that you\u2019ve been waiting months for is one of the most exciting experiences.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will unbox the device with you and give you a brief description of what you\u2019ll receive when you unbox your own Smart POS terminal.</p>\n<p><strong>Package Production and Labelling</strong></p>\n<p>The package itself that carries the device designed after a lot of speculation and thought. We talked to our package manufacturer to select the material for packaging and to our graphic designer to decide upon the labelling of the package. The package plays an essential role in the branding of the product and must match up to the company\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p>The small space offered on the package of any product must be utilized by offering important information to the customers. The Label is also an essential aspect of product branding. For example, the icons on the back of the package are the logos of our partners in production and operations.</p>\n<p>This package of this POS device talks provides information like product description, delivery procedure, contents of the box, etc. The colours used for packaging are white and red, to replicate technology and innovation. The package made with strong material to ensure its safety during shipment and delivery.</p>\n<p>The package is just as classy as the ones used by Apple. However, unboxing the package and receiving a Smart POS device is an altogether different experience than receiving an iPhone. This device will make your business transaction easier and more convenient.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents Of The\u00a0Package</strong></p>\n<p>When you open the box, you will find our latest Smart POS device, a tiny instruction manual, roll of receipt paper, USB charging cable, and charger. It is possible to get a Smart POS device designed in the colour of your company. For example, if your company logo is red, you can get a Smart POS device in the red\u00a0colour.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting Up The\u00a0device</strong></p>\n<p>To start the device, you must first turn on your battery. If you have a sim card available you can insert it in the device right away. When you switch on your terminal, you will see the logo of your brand on the screen of the machine. The personalization feature is an aspect of our branding and we offer the same to our partners when they purchase a white-label solution.</p>\n<p>After the loading has completed, you will come across a launch screen. This screen has keypad and touch audios that you will hear when you take an\u00a0action.</p>\n<p>The next step is to connect the device to a Wi-Fi or Sim card network, personally I prefer Wi-Fi connection. Now that its connected and the address has been verified, you can launch a demo application for payment acceptance.</p>\n<p>You need to enter your credentials and then your cashier Pincode on the device. You can use easy combinations like 1234 to get easy access whenever you want. When you perform your first transaction, you will need to connect the printer to the\u00a0device.</p>\n<p>To make a demo payment, you will have to present your card to the device and enter your Pincode. You will notice mixed numbers because we have applied our \u2018Pin on Glass\u2019 technology. You can learn more about this in one of my other articles. And this is, you are ready to use your new Smart POS terminal at your workplace.</p>\n<p>After two to three months of working on branding, production, and delivery we\u2019re happy that the product is brilliant and efficient. To learn more about Smart POS Terminal machines and how to use them, you can read my other\u00a0blogs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ac758152d057\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du/opening-box-of-first-smart-pos-terminal-from-paymob-ac758152d057\">Opening box of first Smart POS terminal from Paymob</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du\">Kosta Du</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

This device will make your business transaction easier and more convenient.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents Of The\u00a0Package</strong></p>\n<p>When you open the box, you will find our latest Smart POS device, a tiny instruction manual, roll of receipt paper, USB charging cable, and charger. It is possible to get a Smart POS device designed in the colour of your company. For example, if your company logo is red, you can get a Smart POS device in the red\u00a0colour.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting Up The\u00a0device</strong></p>\n<p>To start the device, you must first turn on your battery. If you have a sim card available you can insert it in the device right away. When you switch on your terminal, you will see the logo of your brand on the screen of the machine. The personalization feature is an aspect of our branding and we offer the same to our partners when they purchase a white-label solution.</p>\n<p>After the loading has completed, you will come across a launch screen. This screen has keypad and touch audios that you will hear when you take an\u00a0action.</p>\n<p>The next step is to connect the device to a Wi-Fi or Sim card network, personally I prefer Wi-Fi connection. Now that its connected and the address has been verified, you can launch a demo application for payment acceptance.</p>\n<p>You need to enter your credentials and then your cashier Pincode on the device. You can use easy combinations like 1234 to get easy access whenever you want. When you perform your first transaction, you will need to connect the printer to the\u00a0device.</p>\n<p>To make a demo payment, you will have to present your card to the device and enter your Pincode. You will notice mixed numbers because we have applied our \u2018Pin on Glass\u2019 technology. You can learn more about this in one of my other articles. And this is, you are ready to use your new Smart POS terminal at your workplace.</p>\n<p>After two to three months of working on branding, production, and delivery we\u2019re happy that the product is brilliant and efficient. To learn more about Smart POS Terminal machines and how to use them, you can read my other\u00a0blogs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ac758152d057\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du/opening-box-of-first-smart-pos-terminal-from-paymob-ac758152d057\">Opening box of first Smart POS terminal from Paymob</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du\">Kosta Du</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",

      "description": "\n<p>In my last article, I explained the new soft technology by PayMob that enables merchants to accept contactless payments with the help of their smartphones. This technology is extremely beneficial for small businesses who need a smart POS terminal device, but find it expensive to acquire. Another benefit of the technology is that you can carry the smartphone with you anywhere without a\u00a0problem.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have to make product deliveries and accept payments, you can easily enable your delivery guy to accept contactless payment on their\u00a0phone.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will explain how to complete transactions on your smartphone, in some simple\u00a0steps.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I have two phones with me, one of them will be the merchant\u2019s phone and the other is the buyer\u2019s phone. The merchant phone is a blueberry and the buyer\u2019s phone will be my\u00a0iPhone.</p>\n<p>So all we have here is a phone and not a POS device to perform a payment. Yet, it can accept payments via QR code, barcode, and even debit and credit\u00a0cards.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Merchant Activation:</strong> First you have to activate the payment portal on the merchant phone. You need to insert your cashier credentials and\u00a0Pincode.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Insert amount: </strong>To process the payment you need to enter the amount that the buyer is supposed to pay you. For example, here I am selling a delicious muffin to myself. I will be charging 5 Euros for the muffin and have inserted the same amount on my payments interface.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Activation:</strong> On the customer phone you have to open the application and activate it. The interface on the customer phone will be different from that of the merchant\u2019s. Once you have activated your QR code or Barcode, it will show on the screen of your smartphone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If instead of a smartphone, the buyer wants to pay via their card then they can also do\u00a0so.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Turn on the Camera: </strong>To process the payment. the merchant has to now allow the app to access the mobile\u2019s camera and open it to be able to scan the QR code, barcode, or card\u00a0strip.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scan the code:</strong> If the customer is willing to pay the amount that is being presented on the merchant\u2019s screen then they must hold their smartphone beneath the merchant\u2019s phone. The camera from the merchant\u2019s phone will scan the barcode. Once the scan has been successfully completed, the payment will have been made and the amount will be deducted from the customer\u2019s account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you wish to, you can also refund this money one click. All you need to do is select the customer you wish to refund the money to, from your previous transactions. Click on \u2018Perform a Refund\u2019 and voila, the refund will be successful.</p>\n<p>The interface of the application is simple and smart, you will find it impressive. It is also very informative and helps the user keep track of their transactions. You can also print receipts if you connect the merchant\u2019s smartphone to the\u00a0printer.</p>\n<p>To learn more about this new soft technology, <a href=\"http://www.paymobtech.com/\">click\u00a0here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on social networks:</strong></p>\n<p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=wIiye8_E050&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fpaymobtech%2F&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbk1nZW94c1VTRjY5TDU1LXpkbGtyY1FhY3ZjUXxBQ3Jtc0tuX3l1TlBpZTNKTzhOWDhZbXFfVWZsV05oR3daaVRKc1ppYXBBRFNoV1RQa25xMGo0dUhFREp3OUtNd1dNSUFCT2FRTlZaajBXckJxanU0ekc1c0pIQWVJN0ZNanNDb3RkSkFZT0s1ektBUE1UeGczdw%3D%3D\">https://www.instagram.com/paymobtech/</a></p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=wIiye8_E050&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpaymobtech&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHZuYkJCd3RYY2QySEFBMF9MZWtWQjRic0w2UXxBQ3Jtc0tuX2taVU40T3dCS0Y5NVl6X254RkVjNl9qLTMyWTktVzhpMDdYS1lMWURCMmltM2hDS2RpT3djMmJ6Y1ZrUlc3Z0NtTDNQV3plTUVzZW5OS21Dci1lODcxRGJjekJnVWp6N2VSUzlDZ0hyTldlcTUzUQ%3D%3D\">https://twitter.com/paymobtech</a></p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=wIiye8_E050&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FPaymob-POS-104119208012218%2F&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDR3VkpjVlpxZUNmeTd5UzRCckx5b0tvWVpjZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsUXdLMWJNZ29HN1pkMlNQQmxZdjY5RU9Ud0pKUUlhem5TM3lwQ1dtZ2dfdDJLUTliSWFGV3JReDVZSlpfTGtBdnRYd3ZkcU1oRld3UlhNWFhUU0Y1OXZENjBENG1UbklPVTFQUTh6Q1h5UllUMlZGSQ%3D%3D\">https://www.facebook.com/Paymob-POS-1...</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ZeroCost\">#ZeroCost</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DownloadAndGo\">#DownloadAndGo</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BankingSmart\">#BankingSmart</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BankingOnline\">#BankingOnline</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MerchantServices\">#MerchantServices</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BankingSystem\">#BankingSystem</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Payments\">#Payments</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Payment\">#Payment</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23POSmerchant\">#POSmerchant</a></p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=608328128f08\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du/accept-payments-with-your-smartphone-pos-by-following-these-five-steps-608328128f08\">Accept Payments With Your Smartphone POS By Following these Five Steps</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/kosta-du\">Kosta Du</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n",
